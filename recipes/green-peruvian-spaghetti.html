    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yummy delicous plate of a flavorful pesto green spaghetti. The spaghetti can eaten on its own or as a side preferrably with a fried breaded steak. The spaghetti's main ingredients is pasta basil, oil, garlic, feta, salt and pepper. No variety of nuts are used in this pesto spaghetti much different than it's Italian counterpart.</p>
    <p>This dish is so easy to make my grandma blindfolded while attending a baseball game make it. Unlike other lame Italian pestos this brilliant Peruvian pesto is made from blending rather than through a food proccessor making a smooth lovely velvety pesto that cause you water at the mouth. From blending you will not have bits of basil leaves. Instead your plate will lathered with a beautiful green sauce that is loaded with flavor.</p>
